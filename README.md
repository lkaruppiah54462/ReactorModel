# ReactorModel

A. Topic

Model for Consistent Process Control

B. Why

The Process Control cannot be easily modelled using conventional methods.
Looking at machine learning concepts to solve this / partially answer the 
difficult problem

C. Data

1. Data will be generated on proprietary machine and uploaded to postgres.
2. Data includes all input/output parameters including machine ID.

D. Expected Results

1. To predict input parameter to control the behavior of the process
to produce certain predictable/consistent outcomes needed in manufacturing

E. Logistics

1. Solo Project : Lakshmanan Karuppiah
2. Data : Real Machine Data (multiples)
