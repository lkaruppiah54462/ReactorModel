# ReactorModel

A. Topic

Model for Consistent Process Control

B. Why

The Process Control cannot be easily modelled using conventional methods.
Looking at machine learning concepts to solve this / partially answer the 
difficult problem

C. Data

1. Data will be generated on proprietary machine and uploaded to postgres.
2. Data includes all input/output parameters including machine ID.

D. Expected Results

1. To predict input parameter to control the behavior of the process
to produce certain predictable/consistent outcomes needed in manufacturing

E. Logistics

1. Solo Project : Lakshmanan Karuppiah
2. Data : Real Machine Data (multiples)
3. Initial data was loaded into Postgres and read using sqlalchemy create_engine
4. Multiple data generated from various machine will be merged in postgres
5. alldata.ipynb is the jupyter notebook file with data extraction,transformation, 
and machine model
6. test_results2.csv is the  data file generated and used for inital trial run on the tool to validata model (real validation)
7. tooltest.ipynb is the jupyter notebook file that analyzes the data from the validation run (measured time)
8. Google slide link shows the latest presntation
 
E. Final PRESENTATION (Google Slides Link)
